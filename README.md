I'm a software programmer, mainly .Net/C#, but I'm open to new things and opportunities. Always willing to learn something new to develop as a person and as a professional. 
Currently, I'm working hard on learning SQL and Relational Database, also I'm sharpening my skills in C#.
I've worked in a multicultural environment, so in the process, I have gained good communication skills.
As a supervisor role in Amethyst Group, I have to plan and organize new starters training over a period of a week and access all their training needs.


My skills include Git, C#, .NET, Relational Databases & SQL, Unit Testing, Test Driven Development, SOLID, OOP, Design Patterns, TypeScript & NodeJS basics.
